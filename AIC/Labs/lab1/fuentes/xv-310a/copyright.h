/* Copyright Notice
 * ================
 * Copyright 1989, 1994 by John Bradley
 * 
 * Permission to copy and distribute XV in its entirety, for non-commercial 
 * purposes, is hereby granted without fee, provided that this license 
 * information and copyright notice appear unmodified in all copies.
 * 
 * Note that distributing XV 'bundled' in with any product is considered
 * to be a 'commercial purpose'.
 *
 * Also note that any copies of XV that are distributed must be built
 * and/or configured to be in their 'unregistered copy' mode, so that it
 * is made obvious to the user that XV is shareware, and that they should
 * consider donating, or at least reading this License Info.
 * 
 * The software may be modified for your own purposes, but modified
 * versions may not be distributed without prior consent of the author.
 * 
 * This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied
 * warranty.  In no event will the author be held liable for any damages
 * arising from the use of this software.
 * 
 * If you would like to do something with XV that this copyright
 * prohibits (such as distributing it with a commercial product, 
 * using portions of the source in some other program, etc.), please
 * contact the author (preferably via email).  Arrangements can
 * probably be worked out.
 *
 * XV is shareware for PERSONAL USE only.  You may use XV for your own
 * amusement, and if you find it nifty, useful, generally cool, or of
 * some value to you, your non-deductable donation would be greatly
 * appreciated.  $25 is the suggested donation, though, of course,
 * larger donations are quite welcome.  Folks who donate $25 or more
 * can receive a Real Nice bound copy of the XV manual for no extra
 * charge.
 * 
 * Commercial, government, and institutional users must register their
 * copies of XV, for the price of $25 per workstation/X terminal or per
 * XV user, whichever is less.  Note that it does NOT say 'simultaneous user',
 * but rather, the total number of people who use XV on any sort of 
 * recurring basis. Site licenses are available (and recommended) for those 
 * who wish to run XV on a large (>10) number of machines.  
 * Contact the author for more details.
