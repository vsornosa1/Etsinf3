They said it couldn't be done.  They said it never *would* be done.  
They smiled knowingly to themselves as each predicted release date 
inevitably passed by, unmarked by the emergence of a new version...

Well, who asked them!  And who do they think they are, anyhow!?!

Announcing the Exciting New Release of XV, Version 3.10!

Finally, all the stuff you've been waiting for:  image cut & paste, pixel
editing, text annotation (of a sort), nifty new algorithms, new image formats 
(Targa, XPM, FITS, XWD, IFF), improved schnauzing capabilities, a spiffy
new 'pad' command, and whatnot.  Plenty of whatnot.

Of course, we're particularly proud of our Exclusive 3-D Fish Technology.

At the moment, you can get this decidedly 'fine' piece of software via 
anonymous ftp on the following sites:

   Hostname			Directory
   --------			---------
   ftp.cis.upenn.edu:		pub/xv
   ftp.upenn.edu:		data/bradley
   ftp.duke.edu:		pub/archive/xv
   gatekeeper.dec.com:		pub/graphics/xv

The file is called 'xv-3.10.tar.gz' (or 'xv-3.10.tar.Z' if you don't have 
the 'gunzip' program).

BTW, if any of you fine folks can get these files put up on one of the major
ftp sites (wustl, gatekeeper, etc.) please do so, and let me know!

Enjoy!

John Bradley
