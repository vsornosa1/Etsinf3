How To Obtain This Software (in case all you get is this file)

The software is available for public ftp on
    sgi.com			graphics/tiff/v3.3.src.tar.Z
	(192.48.153.1)

For example,
    % ftp -n sgi.com
    ....
    ftp> user anonymous
    ... <type in password>
    ftp> cd graphics/tiff
    ftp> binary
    ftp> get v3.3.src.tar.Z

In general, the latest version of the 3.3 release of the software is
always available as "v3.3.src.tar.Z" in the ftp directory.  This file
is a link to the appropriate released version (so don't waste your time
retrieving the linked file as well!) Any files of the form v3.3.patch*
are shell scripts that can be used to patch older versions of the
source code.  For example, the file v3.3.patch-1 would contain patches
to update v3.3.src.tar.Z.  Patch files only work to go between
consecutive versions, so if you are multiple versions behind the latest
release, you will need to apply each patch file between your current
version and the latest.


Obtaining the Software by Electronic Mail
-----------------------------------------
Do not send me requests for the software; they will be ignored (without
response).  If you cannot use FTP at all, there is a service called
"ftpmail" available from decwrl.dec.com:  you can send e-mail to
this machine and it will use FTP to retrieve files for you and send you
the files back again via e-mail.  To find out more about the ftpmail
service, send a message to "ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com" whose body
consists of the single line "help".


What to do Once You've Retrieved Stuff
--------------------------------------
The software comes in a compressed tar file.  To extract the
information:

    zcat v3.3.src.tar.Z | tar xf -

(uncompress and extract individual files in current directory).

There is also a companion compressed tar file, v3.0pics.tar.Z
that has sample TIFF image files.  These are mostly useful in
testing the software if/when you port it to an unsupported system.
