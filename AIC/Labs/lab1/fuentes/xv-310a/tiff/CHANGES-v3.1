TIFF Software "Release" 3.10 (changes since 3.00 release)
----------------------------------------------------------
Changes in libtiff:
    o operating system (OS)-dependent code is now isolated in separate
      source files: tif_unix.c, tif_apple.c, tif_msdos.c, and tif_vms.c;
      much of the muck previously located in tiffcompat.h is no longer needed
    o all memory management in the library is now done through three
      internal interfaces: _TIFFmalloc, _TIFFrealloc, and _TIFFfree;
      these routines are intended to be defined in the os-specific code
    o all I/O and I/O-related operations in the library are now done through
      function pointers maintained in each TIFF data structure; this was
      done to better isolate os-dependent code and to make it possible for
      clients of the library to override, on a per-file basis, how I/O is done
    o the mapped file support is no longer conditionally compiled into
      the majority of the library; instead it is now isolated through
      internal interfaces so that only the os-dependent code need be
      concerned with support/non-support
    o a mistake in the use of const in tif_compress.c has been corrected
    o more function prototype definitions have been added for ANSI C
      compilers that are fussy about mixing old and new style declarations
    o the values of the TileWidth and TileLength tags are now required to
      be multiples of 16 (instead of 8) as specified in the final 6.0 spec
    o the G3 decoding routine now treats a premature EOL or bad code as
      a non-fatal error, white-filling the remainder of a scanline
    o TIFFReadRGBAImage can now read CYMK images (using a very simple
      algorithm to convert CMYK->RGB)
    o the LZW code has been updated to use the faster version distributed
      after the v3.0 release
    o a new library interface, TIFFClientOpen, was introduced; this
      routine permits a client of the library to manage all I/O and
      file-related operations (read, write, lseek, close, mmap, umap,
      getfilesize)--this interface is used internally to isolate
      os-dependent functionality
    o a bug where the library calculated the wrong expected size of a
      "short strip" has been fixed
    o a bug in the parameter ordering of TIFFComputeTile has been corrected
    o the numeric values of SAMPLEFORMAT_INT and SAMPLEFORMAT_UINT have
      been changed to reflect the values defined in the final 6.0 spec
    o the SGI build is now done with the ANSI C compilers

Changes in the tools:
    o pal2rgb now correctly converts 16-bit colormap entries to 8-bit values
    o sgigt now handles 8-bit separated (CMYK) images
    o a bug in tiff2ps where resolution scaling was done incorrectly
      has been fixed
    o a bug in tiffdump where non-byte data values were incorrectly
      byte-swapped has been fixed

Changes in the documentation:
    o doc/TIFF6.ps (the 6.0 specification from Aldus) has been updated to
      the "final version" of 6-8-1992.

Changes in the contrib software:
    o the palette test image generator can generate a 1-bit test image;
      also a change was made to the color scaling algorithm
    o the vms support has been updated
